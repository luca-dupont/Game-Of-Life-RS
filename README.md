# Game-Of-Life-RS
Conway's game of life in Rust.

Change the grid size from inside [main.rs](main/src/main.rs) by modifying the `SQUARES` constant.

Simply run `cargo run --release` from the main directory.
> It will be slower on the first run since it has to compile.

Press SPACE to reset the grid.
